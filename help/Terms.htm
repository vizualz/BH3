pursuant to applicable law, Boardhunt disclaims all warranties, express or

<br>
Boardhunt does not warrant that the Service or any of its functions will be
uninterrupted or error-free, that defects will be corrected, or that any part

of the use of the Service or materials in this Service or in third-party sites
in terms of their correctness, accuracy, timeliness, reliability or otherwise.
You (and not <span class=SpellE>Boardhunt</span>) assume the entire cost of all
necessary maintenance, repair or correction. <br>
<br>
The Service should not be used in any high risk activities where damage or
injury to persons, property, environment, finances or business may result if an
error occurs. You expressly assume all risk for such use. Surfing is a fun and
healthy sport, enjoyed by many people from all walks of life. Surfing can also
be a dangerous sport, and may result in serious injuries and even death. <span
class=SpellE>Boardhunt</span> recommends all surfers to respect the ocean. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:black'>Online Commerce <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='color:black'>In
addition, <span class=SpellE>Boardhunt</span> may allow you to purchase many
different types of products and services online that are provided by third
parties. <span class=SpellE>Boardhunt</span> is not responsible for the
quality, accuracy, timeliness, reliability or any other aspect of these
products and services. If you make a purchase from a merchant on the <span
class=SpellE>Boardhunt</span> or on a site linked to by <span class=SpellE>Boardhunt</span>,
the information obtained during your visit to that merchant's online store or
site, and the information that you give as part of the transaction, such as
your credit card number and contact information, is collected by the merchant.
A merchant may have separate privacy and data collection practices. <span
class=SpellE>Boardhunt</span> has no responsibility or liability for these
independent policies. For more information regarding a merchant, its online
store, and its privacy policies, return to that merchant's home page and click
on its information links or contact the merchant website directly. You release <span
class=SpellE>Boardhunt</span> and its affiliates from any damages that you
incur, and agree not to assert any claims against them, arising from your
purchase or use of any products or services made available by third parties
through <span class=SpellE>Boardhunt</span>. <br>
<br>
When you purchase products or services on or through the <span class=SpellE>Boardhunt</span>,
you may be subject to additional terms and conditions that specifically apply
to your purchase or use of such products or services. If you have any questions
about these additional terms and conditions, you should contact the merchant of
such products or services directly. <br>
<br>
You agree to be financially responsible for all purchases made by you or
someone acting on your behalf through the Service. You agree to use the Service
and to purchase services or products through the Service for legitimate,
non-commercial purposes only. You also agree not to make any purchases for
speculative, false or fraudulent purposes or for the purpose of anticipating
demand for a particular product or service. You agree to only purchase goods or
services for yourself or for another person for whom you are legally permitted
to do so. When making a purchase for a third party that requires you to submit
the third party's personal information to <span class=SpellE>Boardhunt</span>
or a merchant, you represent that you have obtained the express consent of such
third party to provide such third party's personal information. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

constituting or encouraging conduct that would constitute a criminal offense,
give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any local, state, national or
international law. <br>
<br>
- Use the Service to post or transmit any information, software or other
material that violates or infringes upon the rights of others, including

other users of the Service. <br>
<br>

which users can supply information or material. However, <span class=SpellE>Boardhunt</span>
reserves the right at all times to disclose any information as necessary to
satisfy any law, regulation or governmental request, or to refuse to post or to
remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, that in <span

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:black'>Classified Advertising <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='color:black'>When

ownership interest in the advertisement as it appears on the Service under
copyright law or otherwise to <span class=SpellE>Boardhunt</span>. Submission
of an advertisement does not constitute a commitment to publish the

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:black'>Limitation of Liability <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='color:black'>Under
no circumstances, including, but not limited to, negligence, shall <span

consequential damages that result from the use of, or the inability to use, <span

materials, products, or services made available through the Service, or any
part of the Service, even if <span class=SpellE>Boardhunt</span> is advised
beforehand of the possibility of such damages. (Because some states do not
allow the exclusion or limitation of certain categories of damages, the above
limitation many not apply to you. In such states, the liability of <span

affiliates is limited to the fullest extent permitted by such state law.) You
specifically acknowledge and agree that <span class=SpellE>Boardhunt</span> is
not liable for any defamatory, offensive or illegal conduct of any user. If you

apply when you use the products or services of a third party that are provided

govern. This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hawai'i</st1:place></st1:State>
without giving effect to any principles or conflicts of law. If any provision
